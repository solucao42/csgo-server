How to change the gamemode of the csgo server?



    You can change the gamemode on your server on the fly by using the rcon commands:

    rcon_password "yourRconPassword";
    rcon game_mode 1;
    rcon game_type 0;
    rcon exec gamemode_competitive;
    rcon mp_restartgame 1;

    If you are adding this to the server.cfg via the web console you do not need the rcon part before each command and therefore it would be:
    game_mode 1; 
    game_type 0; 
    exec gamemode_competitive;


    For a list of the gamemodes/gametypes to configure your server to the disired mode please see below:

    Arms Race  	1 	0
    Demolition  	1 	1
    Deathmatch 	1 	2
